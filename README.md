**Connector**

: The mothership offers the user a birds-eye view of all their projects. Here, a user can access a project dashboard to create tasks, share files, keep project notes, and track progress.

**Task**
: Tasks are pieces of work to be done or undertaken. Clients and freelancers can create tasks within a project. Once a task is created, a freelancer can modify its status to reflect its current position in the workflow. For example, by moving it from "In Progress" to "In review". Clients can also modify the status of a task. A status that is exclusive to clients is "Done", where a client can mark a task complete and initiate the payment process. *(Refer to [Initiation](#Initiation) under Payment Process)

# Project Details

Flan is a freelance platform within the Celo ecosystem. Targeted at designers and developers, the platform is designed to provide best-in-class talent and experience to businesses and individuals. We aim to connect freelancers and clients operating in different areas of the world and increase crypto adoption within the gig-economy. We also aim to provide an easy solution especially for businesses operating in the blockchain industry to hire and pay freelancers without the need for using fiat payments. The platform is currently a web-based PWA that is designed to be mobile adaptive. We offer project creation and management tools such as audio/video/text chat, kan-ban style subtask creation, file sharing, note keeping (shared and private), project matching based on user location and language, portfolio showcasing, and fiat payments using our stripe integration.

## Vision

> **A Sustainable Gig Economy**

Our belief is that freelance is the way of the future. We started Flan to contribute to the movement of creating a sustainable future for the gig economy. As freelancers, we experience many obstacles and roadblocks that may affect our livelihood and wellbeing. We encounter corporate greed on a daily basis while using freelance platforms that are more focused on accumulating profits than valuing people. Flan is here to correct the course by utilizing cutting-edge technology to guarantee prosperity for all.

## Mission

> **Empowering People**

Our goal is to provide freelancers a space to grow and connect clients with phenomenal talents to achieve the full potential of their projects. We believe that exceptional projects are born in environments that celebrate innovation. Therefore, our mission is to create a community of best-in-class talent and provide not only a freelance platform, but a space that fosters passion, innovation, technology, and prosperity; a space where people can meet, form real relationships, and do extraordinary things.

## Our Values

**Drive Change**

We always want to do better. We believe in creating lasting and evolving change whether through empowering people to understand their value, or creating tools that offer a much-needed alternative to a norm, or simplifying convoluted processes.

**Embrace Local**

Instead of looking outward we believe in looking inward. It is our duty to empower our local communities and help each other grow and achieve goals. We believe in life beyond the screen, where happy coincidences happen, meaningful relationships are built, and human connection is valued.

**Empower Expression**

Everyone expresses themselves differently, but our voices are what defines us. At Flan we are amplifying those voices. Whether through a video, an app, a painting or a song; our voices change the world everyday.

**Value People**

Our community is at the heart of what we do. We are all one unit working towards a better future. To us, collective success is born in environments where people value and respect each other.

# Flan Token
## What is FLN?
FLN is an ERC-20 token minted on the Celo blockchain. It is used to facilitate governance, grant access to services, and to incentivize staking.

## Total Supply
100,000,000 FLN

## Token Address
[0x36E3de4FbA4175A4E967ef4a852cb29a8228628E](https://explorer.celo.org/token/0x36E3de4FbA4175A4E967ef4a852cb29a8228628E/token-transfers)

## Initial Token Distribution

![Tokenomics](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6159d8259eb8a308cb0e3d5c/615d68771b4be9a277930ee4_Group%20581%402x.png)


## Initial Staking Rewards
Staking is the delegating of a certain number of FLNs to the governance model and thus locking them out of circulation for a specified length of time. This can increase the value of FLN by limiting the supply. In addition, FLN is also be used for governance, where stakers can participate in validator elections, earn rewards, and vote on decisions concerning the operations of Flan. Voting rights are asymptotically diminishing and follow an exponential decay model.

Flan Tokens are locked up for a period of 2 weeks. At the conclusion of the staking period, tokens can be withdrawn to the staker's linked address or re-staked as long as the staker has no active projects at that time. If the staker has an active project at the conclusion of the staking period, they will not be able to withdraw the staked tokens until all projects in their queue are finished and all payments are sent/received.

## Task Submission NFT
Task Submission NFTs can be minted only by the client of a project on Flan. The client is able to select a project file and mint an NFT of that file. If the client chooses to, they can then post it and sell it on Flan's NFT Marketplace. 

![Task Submission NFT Parameters](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6159d8259eb8a308cb0e3d5c/61ce8e9bb29eb020c8f0f240_NFT%20-%20Task%20Submission%20NFT%20Parameters.svg)

## Media for Sale NFT
Any user can upload a media file to mint and sell an NFT on Flan's NFT Marketplace. The user would either assign a value in Flan Tokens to that NFT or choose the "Best Offer" option where people can place bids on it within a specified timeframe. The user can also specify a royalty rate of up to 12%.

![Media for Sale NFT Parameters](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6159d8259eb8a308cb0e3d5c/61ce8e9b439ed3806de9b374_NFT%20-%20Media%20for%20Sale%20Parameters.svg)

## Access to Services NFT
Any user can be awarded NFTs that grants them access to events. Such as in-real-life Flan events, virtual events, and competitions. These NFTs can only be created by people with access and can be sold in the marketplace following the same process as the "Media for Sale NFTs"

![Access to Services NFT Parameters](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6159d8259eb8a308cb0e3d5c/61ce8e9b60b2280f4fe132b8_NFT%20-%20Access%20to%20Services%20Parameters.svg)

## Portfolio NFT
Once a freelancer creates a profile on Flan, an upgradeable NFT for their portfolio is minted. The NFT evolves as more projects/media are added to the portfolio and updates whenever there's a value change in the set parameters that the NFT holds.

![Portfolio NFT Parameters](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6159d8259eb8a308cb0e3d5c/61ce8e9cc82790164e0af198_NFT%20-%20Portfolio%20NFT%20Parameters.svg)
