# Project Details

Flan is a freelance platform within the Celo ecosystem. Targeted at designers and developers, the platform is designed to provide best-in-class talent and experience to businesses and individuals. We aim to connect freelancers and clients operating in different areas of the world and increase crypto adoption within the gig-economy. We also aim to provide an easy solution especially for businesses operating in the blockchain industry to hire and pay freelancers without the need for using fiat payments. The platform is currently a web-based PWA that is designed to be mobile adaptive. We offer project creation and management tools such as audio/video/text chat, kan-ban style subtask creation, file sharing, note keeping (shared and private), project matching based on user location and language, portfolio showcasing, and fiat payments using our stripe integration.

## Vision

> **A Sustainable Gig Economy**

Our belief is that freelance is the way of the future. We started Flan to contribute to the movement of creating a sustainable future for the gig economy. As freelancers, we experience many obstacles and roadblocks that may affect our livelihood and wellbeing. We encounter corporate greed on a daily basis while using freelance platforms that are more focused on accumulating profits than valuing people. Flan is here to correct the course by utilizing cutting-edge technology to guarantee prosperity for all.

## Mission

> **Empowering People**

Our goal is to provide freelancers a space to grow and connect clients with phenomenal talents to achieve the full potential of their projects. We believe that exceptional projects are born in environments that celebrate innovation. Therefore, our mission is to create a community of best-in-class talent and provide not only a freelance platform, but a space that fosters passion, innovation, technology, and prosperity; a space where people can meet, form real relationships, and do extraordinary things.

## Our Values

**Drive Change**

We always want to do better. We believe in creating lasting and evolving change whether through empowering people to understand their value, or creating tools that offer a much-needed alternative to a norm, or simplifying convoluted processes.

**Embrace Local**

Instead of looking outward we believe in looking inward. It is our duty to empower our local communities and help each other grow and achieve goals. We believe in life beyond the screen, where happy coincidences happen, meaningful relationships are built, and human connection is valued.

**Empower Expression**

Everyone expresses themselves differently, but our voices are what defines us. At Flan we are amplifying those voices. Whether through a video, an app, a painting or a song; our voices change the world everyday.

**Value People**

Our community is at the heart of what we do. We are all one unit working towards a better future. To us, collective success is born in environments where people value and respect each other.
