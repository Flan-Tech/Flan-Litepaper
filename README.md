# Rationale 

The potential offered by alternative means of working such as freelancing or having a digital nomad lifestyle is a pathway many professionals have been  turning to in recent years. The digital infrastructure has provided a good base for matchmaking opportunities between professionals and employers enabled by the worldwide web. As of January 2021, there were 4.66 billion active internet users worldwide, proving the internet’s value and enforcing the UN’s decision to enlist access to it as a human right in 2016. Complementary and integral to this infrastructure are the intermediate banking services that control and monitor the payment transactions these professionals need. Despite the advantages of the traditional banking systems, an estimated 1.7 billion adults out of 4.66 billion internet users remain unbanked; those without an account at a financial institution or mobile money provider. This means that a significant portion of the digital workforce is unable to benefit from the global village due to their unbanked status. Additionally, as account ownership is nearly universal in high-income economies, most unbanked adults live in developing economies.<sup>1</sup>

While working online is not contingent on having a registered banking account, being unbanked is becoming a considerable obstacle for many within the gig economy. A freelancer in a developing economy can be excluded from the thousands of opportunities online simply because their banking credentials, or lack thereof, do not match a set of requirements. Digital Nomad freelancers who choose to have a transnational and mobile lifestyle while working from a laptop are restricted by banks, their transaction fees, and exchange rates. In a time where options are celebrated, having a registered banking service should not be the reason why professionals are limited in what they can provide the gig economy.

It is our belief at FLAN that freelancing should be free from centralized institutions. We founded FLAN because we believe freelancing is a fast-growing and critical part of the economy of the future. Our mission is to revolutionize the gig economy making it more secure, transparent, sustainable, and decentralized. Our vision makes use of Blockchain technology which is shifting how the world operates and concentrates on decentralized networks which create unprecedented opportunities for millions.
Our vision of making a sustainable gig economy can not be realized unless it is centered on supporting emerging communities. We aspire to create the conditions for prosperity through building an accessible and inclusive ecosystem; which has made for an ideal partnership with Celo. Not only does Celo share our values of making the gig economy available to as many professionals as possible around the world, but they also grant us access to one of the most widely used blockchains for real-world use.
With the technology and computing powers at our disposal today, comes the responsibility to rethink the way we work and conduct business. The recent COVID-19 Pandemic has forced us to view the world through new eyes: we no longer need to be at the office to do good and creative work on a 9-5 schedule, we can choose to work at our convenience, conduct virtual meetings, and accomplish our goals. Digital nomadism and freelancing are approaches that are gaining major buy-in and popularity in recent times, therefore we are at a critical point where we need to dig deeper and build the tools of tomorrow.

Together, we can shift norms and create a decentralized digital hub for freelancers and digital nomads worldwide.

# Glossary 

**Client**
: A person or an organization that uses Flan to find and hire a freelancer.

**Freelancer**
: An independent laborer who earns wages on Flan by conducting projects posted by clients. A freelancer on Flan is paid on a per-task basis.

**Connector**
: An individual who connects freelancers to projects.

**Project Ticket**
: A project ticket is created by clients and includes details about the project, such as description, budget and duration preferences. After a ticket is posted, it becomes available for freelancers to apply to it.  

**Mothership**
: The mothership offers the user a birds-eye view of all their projects. Here, a user can access a project dashboard to create tasks, share files, keep project notes, and track progress.

**Task**
: Tasks are pieces of work to be done or undertaken. Clients and freelancers can create tasks within a project. Once a task is created, a freelancer can modify its status to reflect its current position in the workflow. For example, by moving it from "In Progress" to "In review". Clients can also modify the status of a task. A status that is exclusive to clients is "Done", where a client can mark a task complete and initiate the payment process. *(Refer to [Initiation](#Initiation) under Payment Process)

# Project Details

Flan is a freelance platform within the Celo ecosystem. Targeted at designers building for web3 applications (Metaverses, NFTs, Gaming..etc). The platform is designed to provide best-in-class talent and experience to businesses and individuals. We aim to connect freelancers and clients operating in different areas of the world and increase crypto adoption within the gig-economy. We also aim to provide an easy solution especially for businesses operating in the blockchain industry to hire and pay freelancers without the need for using fiat payments. The platform is currently a web-based PWA that is designed to be mobile adaptive and offers project creation and management tools such as audio/video/text chat, kan-ban style subtask creation, file sharing, note keeping (shared and private), project matching based on user location and language, portfolio showcasing, and fiat payments through Stripe.

## Vision

> **A Sustainable Gig Economy**

Our belief is that freelance is the way of the future. We started Flan to contribute to the movement of creating a sustainable future for the gig economy. As freelancers, we experience many obstacles and roadblocks that may affect our livelihood and wellbeing. We encounter corporate greed on a daily basis while using freelance platforms that are more focused on accumulating profits than valuing people. Flan is here to correct the course by utilizing cutting-edge technology to guarantee prosperity for all.

## Mission

> **Empowering People**

Our goal is to provide freelancers a space to grow and connect clients with phenomenal talents to achieve the full potential of their projects. We believe that exceptional projects are born in environments that celebrate innovation. Therefore, our mission is to create a community of best-in-class talent and provide not only a freelance platform, but a space that fosters passion, innovation, technology, and prosperity; a space where people can meet, form real relationships, and do extraordinary things.

## Our Values

**Drive Change**

We always want to do better. We believe in creating lasting and evolving change whether through empowering people to understand their value, or creating tools that offer a much-needed alternative to a norm, or simplifying convoluted processes.

**Embrace Local**

Instead of looking outward we believe in looking inward. It is our duty to empower our local communities and help each other grow and achieve goals. We believe in life beyond the screen, where happy coincidences happen, meaningful relationships are built, and human connection is valued.

**Empower Expression**

Everyone expresses themselves differently, but our voices are what defines us. At Flan we are amplifying those voices. Whether through a video, an app, a painting or a song; our voices change the world everyday.

**Value People**

Our community is at the heart of what we do. We are all one unit working towards a better future. To us, collective success is born in environments where people value and respect each other.

# Flan Token
## What is FLN?
FLN is an ERC-20 token minted on the Celo blockchain. It is used to facilitate governance, grant access to services, and to incentivize staking.

## Total Supply
100,000,000 FLN

## Token Address
[0xa5033ad7F1928566225057Fa3e6F704e8401BC25](https://explorer.celo.org/token/0xa5033ad7F1928566225057Fa3e6F704e8401BC25/token-transfers)


## Initial Staking Rewards
Staking is the delegating of a certain number of FLNs to the governance model and thus locking them out of circulation for a specified length of time. This can increase the value of FLN by limiting the supply. In addition, FLN is also be used for governance, where stakers can participate in validator elections, earn rewards, and vote on decisions concerning the operations of Flan. Voting rights are asymptotically diminishing and follow an exponential decay model.

Flan Tokens are locked up for a period of 2 weeks. At the conclusion of the staking period, tokens can be withdrawn to the staker's linked address or re-staked as long as the staker has no active projects at that time. If the staker has an active project at the conclusion of the staking period, they will not be able to withdraw the staked tokens until all projects in their queue are finished and all payments are sent/received.

## Task Submission NFT
Task Submission NFTs can be minted only by the client of a project on Flan. The client is able to select a project file and mint an NFT of that file. If the client chooses to, they can then post it and sell it on Flan's NFT Marketplace. 

![Task Submission NFT Parameters](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6159d8259eb8a308cb0e3d5c/61d0f0c1a77d7427c193bae2_NFT%20-%20Task%20Submission%20NFT%20Parameters.svg)

## Media for Sale NFT
Any user can upload a media file to mint and sell an NFT on Flan's NFT Marketplace. The user would either assign a value in Flan Tokens to that NFT or choose the "Best Offer" option where people can place bids on it within a specified timeframe. The user can also specify a royalty rate of up to 12%.

![Media for Sale NFT Parameters](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6159d8259eb8a308cb0e3d5c/61d0f0c1e284458d7cc015c2_NFT%20-%20Media%20for%20Sale%20Parameters.svg)

## Access to Services NFT
Any user can be awarded NFTs that grants them access to events. Such as in-real-life Flan events, virtual events, and competitions. These NFTs can only be created by people with access and can be sold in the marketplace following the same process as the "Media for Sale NFTs"

![Access to Services NFT Parameters](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6159d8259eb8a308cb0e3d5c/61d0f0c1cf124c1303465aab_NFT%20-%20Access%20to%20Services%20Parameters.svg)
